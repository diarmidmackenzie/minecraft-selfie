# minecraft-selfie
 face-controlled minecraft avatars


This started off as an example in my face-geometry repo:

- https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/face-geometry
- https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/face-geometry/examples/block-head.html



But I wanted to develop this in ways that weren't really relevant to face-geometry, including

- options for skins & backgrounds
- pose detection.

... so now it's in a repo all of it's own.


Very early stage of development - detailed README to follow as things develop.
