# minecraft-selfie
 face-controlled minecraft avatars

Still very early days, but you can see demos of...

- [Face tracking](https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/minecraft-selfie/pages/index.html)
- [Face & upper body tracking](https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/minecraft-selfie/pages/body-pose.html)

The character stays in a fixed position, but you can use WASD + mouse to change your point of view.



### What is this all about?

This started off as an example in my face-geometry repo:

- https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/face-geometry
- https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/face-geometry/examples/block-head.html



But I wanted to develop this in ways that weren't really relevant to face-geometry, including

- options for skins & backgrounds
- pose detection.

... so now it's in a repo all of it's own.


Very early stage of development - detailed README to follow as things develop.


Coming up next...

- Choose your own skin...

- Gotta get some nice minecraft backgrounds in there.

- Maybe legs, not sure about this...

- Maybe positional movement in space (will be a toggle-able option)
